# Insomni-Cafe
<body>
  <p>Alright so, during class and the entire semsester, this was suppose to be my project I had to finished but never did despite months ahead of time to work on it. To be fair and honest, I was struggling with demotivation and burnout for the past like 2 years. Don't worry, it's gotten better right now but it's still there. I mean, I haven't made any drawings the entire time but maybe I will after school because of stress and also a newbie in adult life :(<br><br>But despite doing barely any phyiscal work on Unity to make my little game, I had a LOT of time to think so, have at it of me ranting for a little while of what I had so far.</p>

# Concept_and_Ideas(Not Finished)
<body>
  <p>Basing off my game from my top favourite game, Stardew Valley, I decided to make this a 2D pixel art cafe game.<br>The name Insomni obvisuoly comes from the word insomnia but I like the vibe it gave off so I used it as the games and cafe's name.</p>
